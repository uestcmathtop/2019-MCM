This is my link: \href{http://www.latex-tutorial.com}{LaTeX-Tutorial}.

You will notice, that there's a colored box shown around the word. Don't worry, this box is not going to show up in your printed document, but only if you view it on your computer.

You can also link to bare URLs without an additional description: \url{http://www.latex-tutorial.com}.

My email address is: \href{mailto:claudio.vellage@latex-tutorial.com}{claudio.vellage@latex-tutorial.com}

preamble hypersetup can be used to set settings and color etc.
